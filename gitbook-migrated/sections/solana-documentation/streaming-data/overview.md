# Overview

Triton's Cascade-enabled Solana endpoints support a direct HTTP transaction submission path that bypasses the JSON-RPC layer entirely:

```
POST /sendtx
```

This endpoint is designed for latency-sensitive workloads where every millisecond of overhead matters. It accepts a plain transaction payload over HTTP and eliminates several sources of latency present in a standard `sendTransaction` JSON-RPC call.

#### Why use `/sendtx` instead of `sendTransaction`?

The standard Solana `sendTransaction` RPC method wraps your transaction in a JSON-RPC envelope, which adds overhead at every stage of the request. The `/sendtx` endpoint removes that overhead.

* **No JSON parsing.** The server receives your transaction bytes directly, skipping JSON deserialization.
* **No CORS preflight.** When using `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` or `text/plain`, browsers skip the preflight `OPTIONS` request. That saves a full round-trip.
* **Smaller payloads.** Without the JSON-RPC wrapper (`jsonrpc`, `id`, `method`, `params`), the request body is smaller on the wire.
* **Simpler client code.** You don't need a Solana JSON-RPC client library. A single HTTP POST is all it takes.

This makes `/sendtx` a good fit for **browser-based applications** that are sensitive to preflight latency and **high-frequency backends** that send large volumes of transactions.

If you need a transaction signature returned in the response, use the `response=signature` query parameter. Otherwise, track signatures client-side before submitting. The signature is deterministic and can be derived from the signed transaction before it is sent.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you prefer the standard Solana RPC interface or need full `sendTransaction` options like `skipPreflight`, you can continue using `sendTransaction` as normal. See our [Transaction sending advice](/chains/solana/cascade/sending-txs.md) for best practices.

#### Request format

**Method:** `POST`\
**Path:** `/sendtx`

The request body should contain your serialized transaction. You can submit it in one of two ways:

* **Raw bytes.** Set `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` and send the transaction as a binary payload.
* **Encoded string.** Set `Content-Type: text/plain` and send the transaction as a text body (base58 or base64). Use the `encoding` query parameter to indicate the format.

#### Query parameters

| Parameter     | Values             | Required    | Description                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `encoding`    | `base58`, `base64` | No          | Encoding format when sending the transaction as text. Defaults to `base58`. |
| `response`    | `signature`        | Recommended | When set, the response body contains the transaction signature on success.  |
| `max_retries` | integer            | No          | Override the default retry count for this transaction.                      |

#### Optional headers

| Header                      | Description                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `solana-forwardingpolicies` | Comma-separated [Yellowstone Shield](/project-yellowstone/shield-transaction-policies.md) policy addresses to apply when forwarding. |

#### Examples

**Raw bytes**

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://<your-endpoint>/sendtx?response=signature&max_retries=3' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' \
  --data-binary @transaction.bin
```

**Base64-encoded transaction**

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://<your-endpoint>/sendtx?encoding=base64&response=signature' \
  -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
  -d '<base64-encoded-transaction>'
```

**Base64 with a Yellowstone Shield forwarding policy**

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://<your-endpoint>/sendtx?encoding=base64&response=signature' \
  -H 'solana-forwardingpolicies: <policy-address>' \
  -d '<base64-encoded-transaction>'
```

#### Response

**On success:**

* HTTP `200 OK`
* If `response=signature` was set, the body contains the transaction signature as plain text.
* If `response=signature` was not set, the body is empty. Derive the signature client-side from your signed transaction before submitting.

**On error:**

* HTTP `4xx` or `5xx`
* The response body contains error details describing what went wrong.

#### Notes

* `/sendtx` is for transaction submission only. It does not support simulation or other RPC methods.
* For best results, follow our [Transaction sending advice](/chains/solana/cascade/sending-txs.md) for client-side retries, compute budgets, priority fees, and preflight handling.
* If you are using Yellowstone Shield policies, see the [Shield documentation](/project-yellowstone/shield-transaction-policies.md) for configuration details.
