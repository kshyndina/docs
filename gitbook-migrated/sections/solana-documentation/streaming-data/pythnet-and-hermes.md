# Pythnet and Hermes

[Hermes](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/hermes) is a web service that listens to both **Pythnet** and the **Wormhole Network** for Pyth price updates, and exposes them through a simple web API. It delivers Pyth’s latest price update format, optimized for on-chain verification and usage.

To access the Hermes API, you’ll need a **Pythnet endpoint** provided by Triton.

<br>

### API Access

Hermes allows clients to:

* Query recent price updates via a REST API
* Subscribe to live price updates via WebSocket

The Pyth Network's JavaScript SDKs use Hermes under the hood to fetch price data.

<br>

### Usage

**Frontend REST Access**

Use this format for frontend clients:

```
https://<unique-subdomain>.mainnet.pythnet.rpcpool.com/hermes
```

**Backend REST Access**

For backend access, include your RPC token before /hermes:

```
https://<unique-subdomain>.mainnet.pythnet.rpcpool.com/<secret-token>/hermes
```

**WebSocket Access**

WebSocket access is available at:

```
https://<unique-subdomain>.mainnet.pythnet.rpcpool.com/hermes/ws
```

or, for backend:

```
https://<unique-subdomain>.mainnet.pythnet.rpcpool.com/<secret-token>/hermes/ws
```

Additional Pythnet RPC Access

Your other Pythnet RPC services are available at:

```
https://<unique-subdomain>.mainnet.pythnet.rpcpool.com/<secret-token>
```

*(Note: this is the base endpoint without the /hermes path.)*
