# Rate and connection limits

#### Why we have rate limits

We apply rate limits to all our nodes to ensure service stability and protect our infrastructure from abusive traffic. Our goal is to allow legitimate application traffic to flow smoothly while mitigating the impact of aggressive bots.

#### How it works

Rate limits are primarily based on your originating IP address. If you exceed the request limit in a given time window, our server will reply with an **`HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`** status code.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Handling a `429` Error**

Your application's logic for handling rate limits is critical. When you receive a `429` error, you **must pause all requests from that IP for 10 seconds**.

Attempting to retry immediately will only result in more `429` errors and will not succeed. A 10-second backoff is required to get out of the rate-limited state.
{% endhint %}

#### Rate limits on the shared service

Our shared RPC pools have standard rate limits designed for well-written frontend dApp traffic.

* **Default limit:** The standard limit for most methods is **1200 requests per 10 seconds** per IP.
* **Stricter limits:** Computationally expensive methods, such as `getProgramAccounts`, have significantly lower limits.
* **View your limits:** To see the specific limits for your endpoint, visit `https://<your-endpoint>.rpcpool.com/ratelimits`.
* **Monitor programmatically:** Shared pool responses include `X-Ratelimit-*` HTTP headers, allowing you to monitor your current usage in real-time.

#### Custom limits for dedicated nodes

If you have a dedicated node, we can customise your rate limits to perfectly suit your workload.
