# Quickstart

Welcome to Triton One! This guide will walk you through the essential first steps to get your application connected to our RPC services.

#### Step 1: Create an account

To get started with using Triton One you will need access to a customer account with an active subscription.

* **Self sign up:** You can sign up following this [link](https://customers.triton.one/onboarding) and make a deposit to activate your account.
* **Contact us directly:** For custom inquiries, you can email us at <support@triton.one> or reach out via [Telegram](https://t.me/tritonone).

Our team will work with you to understand your needs and recommend the best plan, whether it's our shared service or a dedicated node deployment.

#### Step 2: Understand your endpoint vs. your token

Once your account is created, you will receive access to **Endpoints** and **Tokens** through the [Customer Portal](https://customers.triton.one). It is critical to understand the difference:

* **Endpoint URL (for frontend / dApps):**
  * This is the URL you integrate directly into your public-facing dApp or website (e.g., `https://your-app.mainnet.rpcpool.com`).
  * Traffic from these endpoints is typically rate-limited by IP and origin domain to protect against abuse.
  * **Never embed a secret token in your frontend code.**
* **Secret token (for backend services):**
  * A token is a secret key used to authenticate requests from your backend servers, scripts, or trading bots.
  * Backend traffic with a token usually has higher rate limits.
  * **This token must be kept secret.** If you suspect it has been leaked, contact us immediately to have it rotated.

#### 3. Authenticate your request

Triton supports two auth modes:

* **Allowed origins**: tighter rate limit per IP, no secret in the page. Use for browser apps
* **Token auth**: higher rate limit, identifies your account. Recommended for backend services

How you attach the token depends on the protocol.

**x-token header (works for all protocols)**

The `x-token` metadata header authenticates all request types (JSON-RPC, WebSocket, and gRPC).

* Example: `x-token: <your-token>`
* When using the header, the endpoint URL stays clean: `https://<your-endpoint>.mainnet.rpcpool.com`

**Token in the URL path (HTTPS and WSS only)**

JSON-RPC and WebSocket also accept the token in the URL path. Token-in-URL is not supported on gRPC and returns `403`.

Examples:

* `https://<your-endpoint>.mainnet.rpcpool.com/<your-token>`
* `wss://<your-endpoint>.mainnet.rpcpool.com/<your-token>`

#### Step 4: Configure your application

With your endpoint URL, you can now configure your application.

* For standard RPC calls, use the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://...`).
* For WebSocket subscriptions, replace `https` with `wss` (e.g., `wss://...`).

#### Step 5: Explore the documentation

You're all set! Now you can explore the rest of our documentation to make the most of our service:

* Learn about our [**Core features**](/core-features/introduction.md) like [GeoDNS](/core-features/geodns.md) and [Rate limits](/core-features/ratelimits.md).
* Read our guide on [**Best Practices for Sending Solana Transactions**](/chains/solana/cascade/sending-txs.md).
* Discover our [**Advanced data & streaming**](/project-yellowstone/introduction.md) services for real-time insights.
