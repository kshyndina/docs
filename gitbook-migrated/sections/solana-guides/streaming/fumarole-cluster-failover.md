# Fumarole cluster failover

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide shows how to implement cross-region failover for Fumarole from the subscriber side. For an overview of regional clusters and the redundancy model, see [Fumarole Reliable Streams.](/project-yellowstone/fumarole.md)
{% endhint %}

Fumarole runs as **independent regional clusters**. Persistent subscriber state does not replicate across regions. This means that if your primary cluster experiences a major outage, you can fail over to another region, but the cutover is fully customer-managed and requires you to recreate your persistent subscriber on the secondary cluster from the last slot you consumed.

This guide walks through the full failover lifecycle: preparation, detection, cutover, and failback.

#### Scope and assumptions

This guide assumes:

* You have an active Fumarole integration on one regional cluster (your **primary**).
* You have access to a second regional cluster (your **secondary**), the same token works on both.
* You can implement client-side logic that tracks per-cluster state and reacts to outage signals.

The example throughout this guide uses **EU (`ams.rpcpool.com`)** as primary and **US (`nyc.rpcpool.com`)** as secondary. The procedure is symmetric, it applies in either direction.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Triton does **not** orchestrate failover for you, failover is **customer-managed**. We do not synchronize subscriber state, track your last-consumed slot, or trigger the cutover. Everything described below runs on your side. This page tells you exactly what to do.
{% endhint %}

#### Before you start

Failover is only possible if you do the prep work ahead of time. Put these in place during normal operation, not during the outage.

**1. Track the last fully-consumed slot per cluster.**

Your client must keep a record of the highest slot you have successfully processed end-to-end from each cluster. Persist this value durably (e.g. in your database, in Redis, in a file) anywhere that survives a process restart. You will need it to recreate the subscriber on the secondary cluster at the correct position.

Fumarole exposes the last **full** slot you have consumed, so you can rely on that value rather than computing it yourself.

**2. Build your outage-detection logic.**

Decide what counts as a cluster-level failure for your workload (see Detecting an outage below) and instrument the client to surface it.

**3. Make sure your processing pipeline is idempotent.**

There will be a small overlap window during failover where the same slot may be delivered from both clusters. Your downstream processing must tolerate seeing the same slot twice without producing duplicate side effects.

#### Detecting an outage

A failover is only worth the effort when the primary is genuinely down. Transient hiccups should be handled by normal reconnect logic, not failover.

Before triggering a failover, make sure the problem is on the cluster and not on your side. Some signals worth tracking:

* **Stream interruption that does not recover on reconnect.** Fumarole is built to survive normal node restarts and rolling upgrades. If you have been disconnected for more than a few minutes and reconnect attempts keep failing, that is beyond normal recovery.
* **`fume test-config` against the failing endpoint fails or hangs.** This is the most direct check that the cluster is reachable.
* **No new slots advancing.** The `fumarole_offset_lag_from_tip` metric on your client should normally trend toward zero. If it is growing unbounded and your network is healthy, the cluster is not advancing the log.
* **"Not found" or stale errors** for a persistent subscriber you know was healthy minutes ago.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Check whether the problem is differential.** If only some of your clients are affected but others are fine, the problem is likely on your side: network, host, or deployment. Do not fail over.
{% endhint %}

If `fume test-config` succeeds against the failing endpoint and the subscriber exists, but you are not receiving data, that is worth a CS-channel ping before declaring a full failover.

#### Failover procedure

When your detection logic concludes the primary cluster is down, execute the following sequence.

**Step 1 — Stop the primary client**

Halt consumption from `ams.rpcpool.com`. Stop reconnect attempts.

**Step 2 — Read the last fully-consumed slot for the primary**

Read the value you have been tracking. This is the slot from which the secondary subscriber will resume. Call this `last_primary_slot`.

**Step 3 — Create the subscriber on the secondary cluster**

Connect to the secondary cluster and create the persistent subscriber there, starting from `last_primary_slot + 1`.

```bash
fume --config ~/.fumarole/config-us.yaml create \
  --name my-app-failover \
  --from_slot 312500001
```

If a subscriber with that name already exists on the secondary cluster from a previous failover, delete it first:

```bash
fume --config ~/.fumarole/config-us.yaml delete --name my-app-failover
fume --config ~/.fumarole/config-us.yaml create \
  --name my-app-failover \
  --from_slot 312500001
```

The same pattern applies whether you use the Fume CLI or the Rust / TypeScript SDK, create a fresh subscriber pointing at your recovery slot.

**Step 4 — Begin consuming from the secondary**

Start your client against `nyc.rpcpool.com`. Resume normal processing.

Until the secondary catches up to live tip, you will be receiving historical data. Expect some replay delay proportional to the gap between `last_primary_slot` and the current chain tip.

**Step 5 — Confirm forward progress**

Once the secondary is at live tip and slots are advancing normally, your failover is complete. Log the cutover and update your monitoring to track the new active cluster.

#### Failing back to the primary

When the primary cluster recovers, you have a choice:

* **Stay on the secondary.** Acceptable if the secondary is geographically reasonable for your workload.
* **Fail back to the primary.** Necessary if the secondary is far from your backend and you accepted the failover only for availability.

If you decide to fail back, run the failover procedure in reverse:

1. Track the last fully-consumed slot on the secondary.
2. Stop the secondary client.
3. Create the primary subscriber starting from `last_secondary_slot + 1` (deleting the existing primary subscriber first if needed).
4. Start consuming from the primary.
5. Confirm forward progress.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Failback is a planned operation, not an emergency one. Schedule it during a low-traffic window and verify the primary has been stable for some time before cutting back.
{% endhint %}

#### Common pitfalls

* **Failing over on a transient blip.** A single dropped connection is not a cluster outage. Tune your detection thresholds so normal reconnects do not trip failover.
* **Not persisting the last-consumed slot.** If you only hold it in memory and your process restarts mid-outage, you have lost your resume point. Persist it durably.
* **Forgetting the subscriber starts at `last_slot + 1`.** Starting at `last_slot` itself replays the slot you already processed, which widens the duplicate window.
* **Assuming token-or-permission errors mean an outage.** Authentication failures are not outage signals, they indicate a client configuration problem, not a cluster problem.
